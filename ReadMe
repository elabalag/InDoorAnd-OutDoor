In this project, I designed and developed a complete mini AI pipeline to classify images as either indoor or outdoor scenes, simulating the visual recognition that could be used by drones. I started by organizing a dataset, collecting and dividing photos into training and validation folders for both indoor and outdoor categories. Next, I built a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, including data augmentation methods to help the model generalize from the small number of samples available. After training and validating the model, I saved it for use with both a command-line inference tool and a Streamlit-based web app, which lets users upload and classify images instantly with confidence scores. Finally, I prepared the project for deployment by structuring files for GitHub and enabling free hosting on Streamlit Community Cloud. This workflow demonstrates the full process from basic data preparation to web deployment for a practical, end-to-end machine learning solution in drone-based image classification.
